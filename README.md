2_unit_testing and 3_integration_testing were not included as they didn't quite fit the nature of this project.

This PhpMyAdmin database project is meant to simulate a small grocery store's stock system.
Features include:

The system will log all restocks
Accept new products and categories with minimal effort
Show views for specific tables, making them easier to read and understand
Allows for restock modifications, such as giving a reason why a restock has occured
Is easy to set up, only needing the requirements listed in the code folder
Includes a full procedure to manage restocking and the logic behind it
